# Intelligence in biological and artificial systems

At Neurone Lab, we study computation across natural and artificial systems. Our work lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, bioimaging, and computational neuroscience (NeuroAI). We are interested in how principles from biology can inform machine learning, and how computational methods can help us understand biological data.

Our research spans several areas.
In NeuroAI, we explore how neural connectivity and structure can inspire new machine learning architectures, for example by using the _Caenorhabditis elegans_ connectome or biologically motivated sparsity mechanisms in artificial networks. 
In bioinformatics, we work on computational analysis of single-cell omics data, focusing on pathway inference and gene-level regulatory patterns.
In bioimaging, we develop and apply deep learning approaches for microscopy and medical imaging, including super-resolution of tissue data, label-free cell classification, and brain lesion segmentation.
We also have projects in audio signal processing, studying soundscapes and speech enhancement with deep learning models.

We are located at the [DISA-MIS, University of Salerno](https://www.disa.unisa.it/en/department/structures?id=331). If you are interested in collaborating or joining the lab, please [get in touch](/recruitment)

Our work combines methods from machine learning, computational biology, and neuroscience. We use data from cells, tissues, neurons, and connectomes to study how structure and computation interact across different systems.
